# Introduction

This is an architecture description I use for an Android applications for the last years. This architecture showed itself in practice as an easy to understand, suitable and agile enough for most typical Android applications. It's core concepts can be used not only for Android applications, but theoretically for any platform (it was originally based on a server-side app I was participated in, then used in crossplatform Xamarin iOS-Android applications)
